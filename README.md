# Experimental Finnish language model for SpaCy

Finnish language model for [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/). The model contains POS tagger, dependency parser, word vectors, token frequencies, lemmatizer (libvoikko). See below for notes about NER.

## Install the Finnish language model

Install [the libvoikko native library with Finnish morphology data files](https://voikko.puimula.org/python.html).

```
pip install models/python-package/fi_experimental_web_md-0.0.1/dist/fi_experimental_web_md-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load('fi_experimental_web_md')

doc = nlp('HÃ¤n ajoi punaisella autolla.')
for t in doc:
    print(f'{t.lemma_}\t{t.pos_}')
```

## Updating the model

### Development environment setup

Install [the libvoikko native library with Finnish morphology data files](https://voikko.puimula.org/python.html).

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

tools/download_data.sh
```

### Training the model

```
tools/train.sh
```

### Build a Python package

Package just the POS tagger and dependency parser (this is the model published on PyPI):

```
tools/package_model.sh models/taggerparser/model-best
```

Alternatively, to build a model with combined tagger, parser and NER capabilities, run the following. Note that this package can't be distributed because of incompatible source data licenses.

```
tools/package_model.sh models/merged
```
